It is not known whether Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, had accompanied him on what is their 16th wedding anniversary.</p>\n<p>A source close to Charles said he was 'comforted' by the fact he and his father had been in touch more regularly than ever in recent weeks and months - and that they 'had said all the things that needed to be said'.</p>\n<p>The source said: 'It is some small comfort today that the prince was in much more regular contact with his father in recent weeks and months than he otherwise might have been.</p>\n<p>'He was the only family member who was able to visit him in hospital and he was at Windsor as recently as the week before last.

Which is all anyone holds dear at the end.'</p>\n<p>There was no immediate personal reaction from the wider Royal Family, such was their grief. But in a previously recorded tribute to his father, Philip's youngest son Prince Edward told ITV: 'My parents have been such a fantastic support to each other during all those years and all those events and all those tours and events overseas. To have someone that you confide in and smile about things that you perhaps could not in public.</p>\n<p>'To be able to share that is immensely important.'</p>\n<p>Recalling his humour 'which always came through and the twinkle in his eye', Edward added that he would remember his father 'for what he has done in his public life for all the organisations he has supported and influenced'.

He is likely to fly in from his California home to attend his grandfather's funeral, but it is not known if he will be joined by the Duchess of Sussex as she is pregnant.</p>\n<p>Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, said gathering for Philip's funeral could allow the family to have 'a comparative bit of privacy' together.</p>\n<p>He told Times Radio: 'I think there might be a bit of consolation in it for the royal family actually because it just gives them a chance to be close and to have a comparative bit of privacy. Obviously the whole ceremony will be watched by everybody but you think of the complexities of the dynamics in that family and we have to think of Harry, so far away. I'm sure he'll come but not being, the whole time, in the public eye might just help.</p>\n<p>'Many a family gather and get over tension and broken relationships at the time of a funeral. Something very profound unites them all again. And that would be true for this family, I'm sure.'</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>A bearing party of Royal Marines will carry the coffin up the steps and pause for the minute's silence. The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Dean of Windsor will then receive the coffin.</p>\n<p>In keeping with coronavirus guidelines to limit guests inside the chapel, most of the procession will not enter St George's, except for members of the royal family, and the duke's private secretary Archie Miller Bakewell.</p>\n<p>A Palace spokesman said: 'This event will be much reduced in scale with no public access.</p>\n<p>'In line with Government guidelines and public health measures, there will be no public processions and the duke's funeral will take place entirely within the grounds of Windsor Castle.</p>\n<p>'The plans have been given final approval by the Queen and reflect appropriately Government advice.</p>\n<p>'Despite these necessary changes, they still very much reflect the personal wishes of the duke.</p>\n<p>'Although the ceremonial arrangements are reduced, the occasion will still celebrate and recognise the duke's life and his more than 70 years of service to the Queen, the UK and the Commonwealth.'</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/index.html\">Royal Family</a> still faces a dilemma over who to invite to Prince Philip's funeral due to the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/coronavirus/index.html\">coronavirus</a> restrictions in place across England.</p>\n<p>The Queen will only be able to invite 30 people to the ceremony - plus the clergy - at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle.</p>\n<p>Originally there were going to be 800 mourners from across the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/prince-philip/index.html\">Duke of Edinburgh</a>'s military units, charities and associates from across the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p>The final list, which is expected in the next few days, will likely be made up of senior members of the Royal Family as well as the Prime Minister.</p>\n<p>Prince Philip said he wanted a funeral with minimal fuss, but the passing of Britain's longest serving consort was always going to be a big affair - and lorries were today seen hauling scaffolding into Windsor Castle for the preparations.</p>\n<p>His hope for a 'royal ceremonial funeral' - similar to the Queen Mother's - rather than a full state funeral, had already been granted.</p>\n<h3>QUEEN MOTHER'S FUNERAL COST MORE THAN &pound;5.4M </h3>\n<p>The Queen Mother's funeral arrangements in 2002 cost more than &pound;5.4 million.</p>\n<p>A fly-past and a lying-in-state in Westminster Hall were among the events honouring King George VI's consort.</p>\n<p>Policing costs amounted to &pound;4.3 million and the Queen Mother's lying-in-state came to &pound;825,000, according to a House of Commons research briefing paper.</p>\n<p>With Buckingham Palace scaling the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral back and removing the public elements of the day due to pandemic, the cost of Philip's farewell is likely to be substantially less.</p>\n<p>The numbers of police needed will be fewer than originally planned without any processions taking place through the streets of London and Windsor.</p>\n<p>A number of military personnel will gather in the grounds of Windsor Castle to take part in the proceedings before the ceremonial royal funeral on Saturday, but far fewer than had been planned in non-Covid times.</p>\n<p>Philip is also not lying in state, in accordance with his wishes, which will also reduce the security costs.</p>\n<p>Some 11,887 police staff and 1,306 civil staff were deployed from the day of death to the Queen's Mother's funeral, a Metropolitan Police report on the cost of policing public order events during 2002 revealed.</p>\n<p>Of the &pound;4.3 million policing costs, &pound;2.2 million would have been incurred anyway if staff were assigned to other duties, but &pound;2.1 million were additional costs directly attributed to the funeral arrangements.</p>\n<p>The cost to the Home Office for mourning stationery was around &pound;1,817, and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) budget was &pound;301,000.</p>\n<p>Other additional costs were likely, but the cost of the Queen Mother's funeral was shared by the Queen and not met solely by the taxpayer.</p>\n<p>Diana, Princess of Wales's funeral - a form of ceremonial royal funeral - is estimated to have cost between &pound;3 million and &pound;5 million in 1997.</p>\n<p>Baroness Thatcher's ceremonial funeral at St Paul's Cathedral in 2013 cost the taxpayer around &pound;3.2 million.</p>\n<p>The figure includes &pound;2 million in 'opportunity costs' for policing by officers who would have been on other duties on the day.</p>\n<p>A further &pound;943,000 went on providing additional security and policing.</p>\n<p>Ceremonial costs, including the service at St Paul's and the printing and circulation of invitations, came to around &pound;261,976, including &pound;20,445 for the London Ambulance Service and &pound;39,057 for the MoD.</p>\n<p>Lady Thatcher's family made a contribution to the overall cost - including covering the costs of the undertakers and the flowers.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>But the pandemic and restrictions means this has been hastily redrawn, with Her Majesty said to have been in talks with officials last night.</p>\n<p>They tweaked Operation Forth Bridge and are having to drastically scale back the number of people invited to the ceremony, next Saturday.</p>\n<p>The names of those invited have not been released, but it is expected to be mostly made up of senior members of the Royal Family.</p>\n<p>The first names on the list will likely be Her Majesty, Prince Charles and Prince William - those directly in line to the throne.</p>\n<p>Prince Philip's other children are also expected to be there: Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.</p>\n<p>Next could be the partners of the senior royals, who are present at most official events.</p>\n<p>These are Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, the Princess Royal's husband Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence and Sophie, Countess of Wessex.</p>\n<p>The rest of those to be invited is less certain but the remaining could heavily feature more distant members of the Royal Family.</p>\n<p>Princess Anne's children Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall could be there, with Zara's husband and former England rugby star Mike also present.</p>\n<p>Princess Beatrice could be joined by Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, who she married last year.</p>\n<p>Her younger sister Princess Eugenie may well also be invited, along with her husband of three years Jack Brooksbank.</p>\n<p>Sophie, Countess of Wessex's children may also make the cut - Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn.</p>\n<p>It is also likely the Queen will invite her cousins and their spouses: Princess Alexandra, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duke and Duchess of Kent and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, who have offered loyal support and service over the years.</p>\n<p>And the Queen is close to the children of her late sister Princess Margaret - her nephew the Earl of Snowdon and niece Lady Sarah Chatto - and is likely to want them to be present as a source of comfort.</p>\n<p>Before the pandemic, it was planned the vehicle would transport the duke's coffin from Wellington Arch in central London to Windsor, and travel up the Long Walk, with members of the royal family joining the procession part way and walking through Windsor town centre to the castle.</p>\n<p>All public elements of the funeral have been removed - including large-scale processions through London and Windsor - so as not to draw crowds during the coronavirus crisis.</p>\n<p>A Palace spokesman said: 'The duke had a great interest in design so that is where the involvement of the Land Rover comes from.</p>\n<p>'The Land Rover was very much part of the original plans as approved by the duke.'</p>\n<p>Following the duke's death at the age of 99 on Friday, Jaguar Land Rover paid tribute, highlighting Philip's 'significant contribution to UK manufacturing, engineering and design'.</p>\n<p>The firm said on Twitter: 'We are deeply saddened by the passing of His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>'Our thoughts are with Her Majesty The Queen &amp; Royal Family. The Duke devoted his life to public service &amp; made a significant contribution to UK manufacturing, engineering &amp; design.'</p>\n<p>In 2019, the duke, then 97, was driving a Land Rover Freelander when he was involved in a serious car crash involving a mother and a baby.</p>\n<p>The car Philip was driving was hit by another vehicle when he pulled out of a driveway on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk on to a busy A road, after being dazzled by the low sun.</p>\n<p>The duke's car flipped over and he was trapped, and had to be rescued through the sunroof by a passing motorist. He was miraculously unscathed.</p>\n<p>The baby was unhurt, but both women in the other vehicle had to be treated in hospital, and one broke her wrist.</p>\n<p>Three weeks after the crash, Buckingham Palace announced that Philip's driving days on public roads were finally over and that he had voluntarily surrendered his driving licence.</p>\n<p>The CPS later confirmed Philip would face no action over the crash.</p>\n<p>The Queen and Philip's 10 great-grandchildren - Savannah and Isla Phillips; Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cambridge; Mia, Lena and Lucas Tindall; Archie Mountbatten-Windsor; and August Brooksbank - are likely to be considered too young to attend the televised proceedings as all are aged 10 and under.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Little girls left floral tributes to the Duke outside Buckingham Palace this afternoon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Little girls left floral tributes to the Duke outside Buckingham Palace this afternoon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>Little girls left floral tributes to the Duke outside Buckingham Palace this afternoon</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Union flag flies at half mast as the sun sets behind Buckingham Palace this evening\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>The Union flag flies at half mast as the sun sets behind Buckingham Palace this evening</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Sailors firing the Death Gun Salute with the Salting Gun to mark the passing of Britain's Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, aboard the Daring-class air-defence destroyer HMS Diamond at sea in the Channel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>Sailors firing the Death Gun Salute with the Salting Gun to mark the passing of Britain's Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, aboard the Daring-class air-defence destroyer HMS Diamond at sea in the Channel</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Kings Troop Royal Horse Artillery also fired to mark the passing of Philip, at their historic Parade Ground, Woolwich Barracks. The same guns were also fired for Philip's wedding to the Queen in 1947 and at her Coronation six years later in 1953\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>The Kings Troop Royal Horse Artillery also fired to mark the passing of Philip, at their historic Parade Ground, Woolwich Barracks.

Prince Andrew, who lives in Windsor Castle's grounds, was also seen arriving after 10am. Prince Charles stayed with the Queen until late last night.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Britons have defied public health advice to stay at home and continued to lay flowers for Prince Philip during socially distanced vigils at royal palaces today as the country marks his death at the age of 99.</p>\n<p>The bouquets, flowers, cards, Union Flags and balloons are being moved away by staff almost as soon as they are left - but royal aides insist they will all be saved and looked at by the Royal Family inside the grounds of Windsor and Buckingham Palace.</p>\n<p>Palace security have even put up signs urging people not to congregate, but waves of mourners are still arriving to pay their respects to Her Majesty's devoted husband, who dedicated his life to public service and supporting her through their 73-year marriage.</p>\n<p>Well-wishers, all respecting social distancing and wearing masks, laid their tributes and briefly stood to pay their respects, with some wiping away tears or quietly singing hymns before returning home.</p>\n<p>Philip is expected to be laid to rest in the Royal Vault during his private family funeral at St George's Chapel next Saturday, stripped back due to Britain's ongoing lockdown, with only 30 relatives able to attend. Britons are being warned to stay at home and watch on TV to avoid spreading coronavirus.</p>\n<p>His grandson Prince Harry is expected to return to the UK and be among the small number of mourners at the funeral, but it is unlikely his pregnant wife Meghan will accompany him, weeks after the couple accused the Royal Family of racism in their bombshell Oprah interview while Philip lay in hospital.</p>\n<p>Details about Prince Philip's 'peaceful' death have emerged, with his wife of 73-years understood to have been at his bedside when he slipped away yesterday morning after becoming gravely ill late on Thursday, according to the Daily Telegraph. </p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Soldiers stand straight as guns fire at the Tower of London today as the salute could be heard all over the

It was his final solo appearance at the official engagement</p>\n<p>One such moment came when he dropped his reading glasses. A footman in attendance leapt forward to pick them up.</p>\n<p>'Never mind,' the duke said, raising his arm. 'I'll do it.' And so he did, bending down to the floor. On another occasion the Queen was overheard reflecting that her husband of 73 years was refusing to use his hearing aid. 'It means we have to shout,' she said.</p>\n<p>Some are bound to focus on that looming centenary of Philip's 100th birthday in June, which will no longer be the celebration once envisaged.</p>\n<p>But the duke was not a sentimental man. For him it was far more important to die at home in his own bed, the date immaterial.</p>\n<p>That it should have been at Windsor Castle where his mother Princess Alice, a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria, was born was of infinitely more significance.</p>\n<p>In recent days he had been often confined to his room, but in the weeks since his release from hospital last month &ndash; he spent 28 days in the King Edward VII's and St Bartholomew's hospitals &ndash; he has been calmer and quieter.</p>\n<p>Food would be sent up on a tray but he often had little appetite.</p>\n<p>Routines inevitably had to change. He cancelled his 7.30am calling tray of morning tea that a valet or page would bring to his room where, among the few personal possessions he always kept on display, there were two framed photographs &ndash; one of his wife and the other of his mother.</p>\n<p>Intriguingly, among the family photographs of children and grandchildren he always kept on his office desk at Windsor, was one of Prince Charles and Princess Diana taken on their wedding day.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Queen and Philip welcomed a new great-grandchild - their eighth - with the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor.

There was a valet to draw a bath but according to insiders at least until very recently Philip was still dressing himself.</p>\n<p>On warm days he asked for a chair to be taken outside and he would sit in the sunshine with a rug over his legs. Often he would nod off.</p>\n<p>Walking was difficult and around his apartment he used a stick. Occasionally he would allow himself to be pushed in a wheelchair but staff were wary of suggesting it. 'When it first appeared in the private rooms he shouted: 'Get that bloody thing out of my sight!', recalls an aide.</p>\n<p>This unwillingness to betray any sign of frailty was characteristic.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Princess Elizabeth photographed in Clarence House in July 1951, with the Duke of Edinburgh\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>Princess Elizabeth photographed in Clarence House in July 1951, with the Duke of Edinburgh</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Queen Elizabeth II, wearing the Imperial State Crown, and Prince Philip, in uniform of Admiral of the Fleet, wave from Buckingham Palace in London after the Coronation in June 1953\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>Queen Elizabeth II, wearing the Imperial State Crown, and Prince Philip, in uniform of Admiral of the Fleet, wave from Buckingham Palace in London after the Coronation in June 1953</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Queen Elizabeth II on the balcony at Buckingham Palace after her coronation, on June 2, 1953.

This picture was taken in 1968 at Windsor Castle</p>\n<p>But for the pandemic, things might have been so very different. At Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate Philip had adjusted to a new kind of life, sometimes with the Queen but often alone or entertaining friends such as Countess Mountbatten, the former Lady Penny Romsey, to whom he taught the sport of carriage driving.</p>\n<p>When lockdown commenced last March Philip was whisked to Windsor to join the Queen. He did return to his beloved Wood Farm &ndash; thanks once again to the Queen. After cutting their stay at Balmoral last summer to just six weeks, they then spent three weeks at the Norfolk bolthole.</p>\n<p>With its simple furnishings and modest size, it was the closest the couple came to leading an ordinary non-palace life.</p>\n<p>On one occasion at a picnic a domestic servant, unfamiliar with royal tradition, mixed a salad dressing &ndash; only for the Queen to exclaim when she arrived a little after her husband: 'I can't believe the Duke of Edinburgh has made the vinaigrette, he knows I like to do it.'</p>\n<p>Philip himself loved the solitude of north Norfolk. When he was there alone he had just a valet and a cook to take care of him. But after his illness and with the country in a third lockdown the prospect of him returning to Wood Farm was impossible.</p>\n<p>Instead, he had only one ambition: he was determined not to end his days in hospital. 'When he came back to Windsor he said he was not going back to any hospital,' an insider said.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Queen wearing a tartan skirt with corgis beside her and Prince Philip wearing a kilt in Balmoral in 1994\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>The Queen wearing a tartan skirt with corgis beside her and Prince Philip wearing a kilt in Balmoral in 1994</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh laugh as they bid farewell to Irish President Michael D.

But it will likely not be his permanent resting place.</p>\n<p>The biggest of seven interment sites inside the chapel, the vault houses the remains of King George III, whose almost six-decade reign included the years of the American Revolution. His sons King George IV and King William IV are also buried there.</p>\n<p>The vault has also been the temporary resting place for almost 30 royals, including Philip's mother, Princess Andrew of Greece.

His family ties were just as broad, with Britain's longest-serving consort linked by blood and marriage to most of the continent's royal houses.</p>\n<p>&quot;If Queen Victoria is considered the grandmother of Europe, Prince Philip is the uncle of Europe,&quot; said Vassilis Koutsavlis, president of the Tatoi Royal Estate Friends Association.</p>\n<p>It's in that densely wooded estate at the foot of a mountain north of Athens that Philip's father, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, lies buried. The Tatoi estate housed the royal summer residence and the royal cemetery, dotted with the tombs of Philip's relatives: kings and queens of Greece, princes and princesses of Denmark, grand duchesses of Russia and even a distant relative of Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>\n<p>Philip died on April 9 at age 99 and his funeral is on Saturday at Windsor Castle.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>PORT STANLEY, Falkland Islands &mdash; A memorial service was held in the capital of the Falkland Islands on Friday to mark the passing of Prince Philip following his death last week at the age of 99.</p>\n<p>Members of the local government, military officials and residents attended the event which took place in Christ Church cathedral in the center of Port Stanley.</p>\n<p>Many present held their own personal memories of the Duke of Edinburgh who visited the British overseas territory in the South Atlantic in 1957 and again in 1991.</p>\n<p>Various photographs of the two visits were on display in the church, one showing a smiling Philip alongside locals set beside a single-lit candle.</p>\n<p>Islanders in attendance paid testament to his irascible nature, recounting stories of his visit, which included winning a horse race and a fishing trip with residents.</p>\n<p>The Duke of Edinburgh's funeral will take place at Windsor Castle in London on Saturday.</p>",

In normal circumstances there would be a wake, but coronavirus rules allow only outdoor gatherings of up to six people. The televised ceremonial aspects of the funeral will start at 2pm.</p>\n<p>A Palace spokesman stressed the funeral will be a 'family event' said the Royal Family was 'grateful' and 'touched' for all the messages of condolence from around the world and at the way so many people had shared 'fond memories' of the duke.</p>\n<p>Among the other guests are the Duchess of Cornwall, all of the duke's grandchildren and their spouses, the children of the Queen's sister Princess Margaret and three of Philip's German relatives - Bernhard, the Hereditary Prince of Baden; Donatus, Prince and Landgrave of Hesse; and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.</p>\n<p>Also invited is a close friend of the duke, Countess Mountbatten of Burma, previously known as Lady Romsey and later Lady Brabourne, who was Philip's carriage driving partner and one of his closest friends.</p>\n<p>While the Queen will be joined by her lady-in-waiting on her way to the service, she will sit by herself in the quire of the chapel, with all mourners following Covid-19 guidelines and remaining socially distanced. The lady-in-waiting will not sit in the quire and is not counted among the guest list of 30.</p>\n<p>Leading the procession to the chapel will be the Band of the Grenadier Guards, followed by the Major General commanding the Household Division, service chiefs, the Duke of Edinburgh's coffin borne on a custom-built Land Rover hearse, members of the royal family on foot, Philip's household staff, and finally the Bentley carrying the Queen.</p>\n<p>The Palace has not said which lady-in-waiting will accompany Her Majesty in the vehicle.</p>\n<p>The Queen's ladies-in-waiting, personally chosen by the monarch, have a variety of duties including attending to private and personal matters for the Queen and handling her correspondence.</p>\n<p>They include her senior lady-in-waiting, Lady Susan Hussey, who was married to the late BBC chairman Marmaduke Hussey.</p>\n<p>The Queen's ladies-in-waiting have also been part of HMS Bubble - the name given to the reduced selection of around 20 staff attending to the Queen at Windsor during lockdown.</p>\n<p>Some of the ladies-in-waiting have been with the Queen for more than 50 years and act as both friends and loyal assistants, and their discretion and support will be invaluable.</p>\n<p>Details of Philip's funeral were released by Buckingham Palace Thursday night and it has been confirmed the Queen - like all 30 guests invited to the service - will wear a facemask in the car and in the chapel.</p>\n<p>The Queen will depart the Sovereign's Entrance in the state Bentley accompanied by a lady-in-waiting at 2.44pm.</p>\n<p>Prince Harry has spoken in the past about how he and William are on 'different paths' and have good and bad days in their relationship.</p>\n<p>Their brotherly bond was put under further strain after the Sussexes' interview with Oprah Winfrey where they accused a royal family member of racism, something William strongly denied.</p>\n<p>Asked whether arrangements for the procession reflected the royal siblings' relationship, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'This is a funeral, we're not going to be drawn into those perceptions of drama, or anything like that, this is a funeral.</p>\n<p>'The arrangements have been agreed, and they represent Her Majesty's wishes, so we're not going to say anything more on that.'</p>\n<p>The Buckingham Palace spokesman stressed the duke's funeral will 'at its heart' be a 'family event'.</p>\n<p>He said: 'We are following the Covid guidelines, there (is) a limit on who could be invited as a guest and Her Majesty wanted to ensure that all branches of the duke's family were there, and had to make - I think fair to say - difficult decisions about who would be there.'</p>\n<p>BBC broadcaster Huw Edwards will lead nearly six hours of coverage broadcast from Windsor across three programmes on Friday and Saturday, while ITV News' funeral coverage on Saturday will be led by Tom Brady and Julie Etchingham.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Earl and Countess of Wessex (pictured last November) will both be attending the funeral at Windsor Castle on Saturday\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"James Viscount Severn, the son of the Earl and Countess of Wessex\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Lady Louise Windsor, the daughter of the Earl and Countess of Wessex\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Princess Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Peter Phillips\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Zara Tindall and Mike Tindall\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>Peter Phillips (left) and Zara Tindall and Mike Tindall (right) will all be attending the service at Windsor Castle this weekend</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Daniel Chatto\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Lady Sarah Chatto\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Princess Alexandra is one of the 30 members of the Royal Family who will be in attendance at the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Earl of Snowdon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Duke of Kent\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Duke of Gloucester\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>The Duke of Kent (left) and Duke of Gloucester (right) will both be at the funeral which takes place from 3pm on Saturday</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<h3>What are the key timings for Prince Philip's funeral?</h3>\n<p>The ceremonial arrangements for Prince Philip's funeral on Saturday will reflect military affiliations and personal elements of his life. The congregation will wear masks for the service and members of the royal family will be wearing morning coat with medals or day dress. Philip has been lying at rest in the private chapel in Windsor Castle. Here is a timeline of events:</p>\n<ul><li>11am: The coffin, which will be covered with Philip's personal standard along with his sword, naval cap and a wreath of flowers, will be moved from the private chapel to the Inner Hall of Windsor Castle by members of The Queen's Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards.</li><li>2pm: The Lord Chamberlain, the Constable and Governor of Windsor Castle and the Dean of Windsor will be present in the Inner Hall.</li><li>2.10pm: The Dean will say prayers before leaving by car to St George's Chapel.</li><li>2.15pm: Representatives from the services are in place in the Quadrangle to show Philip's special military relationships. The Quadrangle will also be lined by the Household Cavalry and The Foot Guards.</li><li>2.17pm. The band of the Grenadier Guards will be in Engine Court.</li><li>Between 2.20pm and 2.27pm. Members of the royal family and Philip's relatives who are not taking part in the procession will leave Windsor Castle by car to make the journey to the chapel.</li><li>2.27pm. The Land Rover, upon which the coffin will be placed, enters the Quadrangle via George IV Gate where bands at the site begin to play music. The service chiefs, the Major General commanding the Household Division and his staff leave from the Equerries Entrance and take their position by the State Entrance. They will face the Land Rover. The pall bearers take up position either side of the Land Rover and together they move towards the State Entrance.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>2.38pm: The coffin is lifted in the Inner Hall.</li><li>2.40pm: Members of Philip's household take up their positions in the procession and the bands stop playing music.</li><li>2.41pm: The coffin emerges from the State Entrance and is met by members of the royal family who are walking in the procession. They will not be wearing uniforms. A royal salute is given by the service detachments, the service chiefs, the pall bearers, the Major General commanding the Household Division and his staff give a royal salute. The coffin is placed on to the Land Rover.</li><li>2.44pm: The Queen, accompanied by a lady-in-waiting, leaves from the Sovereign's Entrance in the State Bentley as the national anthem is played. The Bentley will pause as it reaches the rear of the procession so the front section of the procession can turn to face the direction of travel.</li><li>2.45pm: The procession, which is planned to take eight minutes, sets off. The firing of minute guns by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery from the East Lawn and the sound of the Curfew Tower Bell will form the backdrop as members of the royal family who are already at St George's Chapel stand to view the procession. The Queen will be received by the Dean of Windsor who will show the mourners at the service, including those who have been watching the procession, to their seats. A royal salute is given by the Windsor Castle Guard as the coffin passes the Parade Ground. The Band of the Grenadier Guards will stop playing and march through into Denton's Commons as the procession approaches. The Rifles Guard of Honour, positioned in Horseshoe Cloister, will give a royal salute and the national anthem will be played. The service chiefs, the Major General commanding the Household Division and his staff will halt on the north side of the West Steps and turn to face the coffin.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>2.53pm: The Land Rover arrives at the foot of the West Steps of the chapel. A Royal Navy piping party will sound once the Land Rover stops and the pall bearers take their positions. The coffin will be carried up the steps and halt on the second landing as members of the royal family take their positions on the steps.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>3pm: The National Minute's Silence, signalled by a gun fired by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, takes place. After the minute's silence, the Dean of Windsor and the Archbishop of Canterbury receive the coffin which has been followed by the members of the royal family who have walked in the procession. As the doors to St George's Chapel close to the sound of Carry On being played, the Land Rover, service chiefs, realm defence advisers, bodyguards, military knights of Windsor, along with representatives of services, will leave in silence during the funeral service. After the National Minute's Silence, the coffin is placed on the Catafalque in the Quire and members of the royal family who have walked in the procession will take their places for the service which is set to last 50 minutes and will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor. The Dean will give the commendation as the coffin is lowered into the Royal Vault. A lament will then be played by a Pipe Major of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. The piper will walk from the North Quire Aisle to The Dean's Cloister. The Last Post will be sounded by buglers of the Royal Marines from the west end of the Nave. After a period of silence, the Reveille will be sounded by the State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry from the west end of the Nave. The buglers of the Royal Marines will sound Action Stations and this is at the specific request of The Duke of Edinburgh. The Archbishop of Canterbury will pronounce the Blessing, after which the national anthem will be sung by the four singers present.</li><li>After the service: The Queen and members of the royal family and Philip's relatives will leave the chapel via the Galilee Porch.</li></ul>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>A senior palace official said: 'The dean will give the commendation as the coffin is lowered into the royal vault, Garter Principal King of Arms will then proclaim His Royal Highness' styles and titles from the sanctuary.'</p>\n<p>The Duke's project to custom build his own Land Rover hearse spanned 16 years, with Philip requesting a repaint in military green and designing the open top rear and special 'stops' to secure his coffin in place.</p>\n<p>Philip's modified Land Rover Defender TD5 130 chassis cab vehicle has been unveiled for the first time, two days before his final farewell in St George's Chapel.</p>\n<p>The duke, who died aged 99 on Friday, made the final adjustments in 2019, the year he turned 98.</p>\n<p>He first began the long-lasting venture to create his own bespoke hearse in collaboration with Land Rover in 2003, the year he turned 82.</p>\n<p>The polished sturdy, utilitarian vehicle, with its heavy duty wheels and angular structure, stands as a showcase for the duke's practical nature, and his passion for functional design and engineering.</p>\n<p>The Defender was made at Land Rover's factory in Solihull in 2003 and Philip oversaw the modifications throughout the intervening years.</p>\n<p>The duke, who served with distinction in the Second World War and held special associations with all the Armed Forces, requested the original Belize Green bodywork be switched to Dark Bronze Green, a colour used for many military Land Rovers.</p>\n<p>He also designed the open top rear section where his coffin will rest, made to his exact specifications, including the rubber grips on silver metal pins known as the 'stops' or 'stoppers' which perform the crucial task of preventing the coffin from moving.</p>\n<p>Details on the vehicle include matching green hubs, a black front grille, a single cab and no registration plates.</p>\n<p>Eighteen years after the duke began the Land Rover project, the vehicle will finally be used for its intended function on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The vehicle will ferry Philip's coffin in a slow procession from the state entrance of Windsor Castle through the grounds to the west steps of St George's Chapel, followed by the Prince of Wales and other members of the royal family on foot.</p>\n<p>Land Rover has maintained the vehicle since it was built and has prepared it for the funeral in collaboration with the Royal Household.</p>\n<p>Jaguar Land Rover's chief executive Thierry Bollore hailed Philip's 'impressive knowledge and deep interest in vehicle design, engineering and manufacturing'.</p>\n<p>He said: 'We are deeply privileged to have enjoyed a very long and happy association with the Duke of Edinburgh over many decades.</p>\n<p>'We are also honoured that the Land Rover which the duke designed will be used at the funeral on Saturday. The duke was a tremendous champion for design, engineering and technology.</p>\n<p>'During his visits to our sites he engaged with hundreds of employees and demonstrated his impressive knowledge and deep interest in vehicle design, engineering and manufacturing.</p>\n<p>'The duke was a truly remarkable man and will be greatly missed.'</p>\n<p>Prince Philip used Land Rovers throughout his adult life and granted his Royal Warrant to Land Rover over 40 years ago.</p>\n<p>He visited Jaguar Land Rover's manufacturing facilities on numerous occasions over the decades and accompanied the Queen when she opened Jaguar Land Rover's new Engine Manufacturing Centre in Wolverhampton in 2014.</p>\n<p>The Land Rover's original role would also have been to transport the duke 22 miles from Wellington Arch in central London to Windsor, but the coronavirus pandemic curtailed the long-held plans for military parades in honour of Philip through the streets of both the capital and the Berkshire town.</p>\n<p>It will be flanked by pall bearers reflecting the duke's special relationships with the military, the Royal Marines, Regiments, Corps and Air Stations.</p>\n<p>Palace officials have told how the duke's interest in design sparked his desire to make the Land Rover and include it in his funeral plans, codenamed Operation Forth Bridge.</p>\n<p>Two Land Rovers were made for 'belt and braces' in case a backup was needed.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the duke, then 97, was driving a Land Rover Freelander when he was involved in a serious car crash involving a mother and a baby.</p>\n<p>The car Philip was driving was hit by another vehicle when he pulled out of a driveway on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk on to a busy A road, after being dazzled by the low sun.</p>\n<p>The duke's car flipped over and he was trapped, and had to be rescued through the sunroof by a passing motorist.

His work on the bespoke Land Rover Defender TD5 130 chassis cab begun in 2003, the year he turned 82, and was finished aged 98 in 2019.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Land Rover designed by the Duke has now been unveiled\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/the_open/index.html\">The open</a> top rear has been modified to fit his coffin and equipped with special rubber grips on silver pins - known as the 'stops' - to keep it secure while it makes the journey through Windsor to St George's Chapel.</p>\n<p>A military man to his core, Philip also requested the original Belize Green paintwork was changed to Dark Bronze Green like those used by the armed forces.</p>\n<p>The military green repaint was one of many modifications Philip made to the vehicle, that was first built a the manufacturer's Solihull factory. With heavy duty wheels and angular structure, the sturdy design stands testament to the Duke's penchant for engineering and functionality.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Jaguar Land Rover's chief executive has admired Philip's handiwork, hailing his 'impressive knowledge and deep interest in vehicle design, engineering and manufacturing'. Land Rover has maintained the vehicle since it was built and has prepared it for the funeral in collaboration with the Royal Household.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>Insignia, orders, decorations and medals are a way of a country saying thank you and recognising someone's achievements.</p>\n<p>Stephen Segrave, Secretary of the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, said: 'There will be nine cushions with insignia placed on pre-positioned around the altar at St George's Chapel in Windsor.</p>\n<p>'They represent British and Commonwealth orders and decorations, and the final cushion with orders from Greece and Denmark, for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>'The Duke of Edinburgh had, I think, 61 decorations and awards from 53 different other countries, and there simply just wasn't the space to have them all on display at the funeral.'</p>\n<p>Asked how it was decided what would go on display, Mr Segrave said: 'I think if you have to draw the line somewhere, the line was drawn at Commonwealth orders and decorations, and those two countries that are appropriate to the Duke of Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>'And he certainly had a hand in planning his arrangements, so he would have made the decision himself.'</p>\n<p>Mr Segrave said the chosen insignia would have 'absolutely' meant a great deal to Philip.</p>\n<p>The plans for Philip's funeral - codenamed Forth Bridge - have been in place for many years, and were updated and reviewed regularly by Buckingham Palace staff in consultation with the Queen and the duke.</p>\n<p>The insignia are sewn in place on the cushions with fishing wire as it is see-through and therefore tends not to show up in the way coloured thread would.</p>\n<p>The regalia was sewn on to the cushions at St James's Palace by two seamstresses, including Diane Hatcher from Cleave Court Jewellers, earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Among the chosen pieces are the Order of the Garter which consists of a collar made out of 22 carat gold, a badge with Saint George slaying the dragon known as the greater George, a sash with a badge called the lesser George, a breast star with the motto of the order, 'Honi soit qui mal y pense', which translates as 'Evil to him who evil thinks', and the garter itself.</p>\n<p>Others include the Royal Victorian Order collar and badge, British Empire collar and Grand Masters badge, Royal Victorian Chain and Order of Merit.</p>\n<p>The Order of Merit is restricted to 24 members and is awarded in recognition of outstanding service in the Armed Forces, science, literature, art and the promotion of culture.</p>\n<p>One particular cushion has the Field Marshal's baton - the most senior appointment in the British Army - next to Philip's RAF wings.</p>\n<p>A qualified pilot, the duke gained his RAF wings in 1953, helicopter wings in 1956 and private pilot's licence in 1959.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Detail of Philip's full size Medal Group, sewn onto a cushion in St James's Palace in London, which

They are Bernhard, Hereditary Prince of Baden; Prince Donatus, Landgrave of Hesse; and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.</p>\n<p>Countess Mountbatten is the wife of Earl Mountbatten, Norton Knatchbull - the grandson of Philip's beloved uncle the 1st Earl Mountbatten, who was murdered by the IRA in 1979. Philip first began teaching Penny the daredevil equestrian sport of carriage driving in 1994 and they remained firm friends for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>They were often pictured together at the Royal Windsor Horse Show, sometimes riding mini motorcycles around the carriage driving course. She was a regular visitor at the duke's Wood Farm cottage at Sandringham after his retirement.</p>\n<p>Others on the guest list include the Queen's first cousins Princess Alexandra, the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent, who loyally supported the monarch and Philip by carrying out royal duties over the decades. But missing from the list of the monarch's cousins is Prince Michael of Kent, 78, who is not a working royal.</p>\n<p>There was also not room for the spouses of the Queen's cousins - the Duchess of Gloucester and the Duchess of Kent, nor Prince Michael's often controversial wife, Princess Michael of Kent. Also invited were the children of the Queen's late sister Princess Margaret - the Earl of Snowdon and Lady Sarah Chatto and her husband David Chatto. The Queen is particularly close to Lady Sarah.</p>\n<p>Guests also include the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Princess Royal and husband Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence, the Duke of York, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Duke of Sussex, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and their spouses, Peter Phillips and Zara and Mike Tindall.</p>\n<p>A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'At its heart it is still a family event. We are following the Covid guidelines. There was a limit on who could be invited as a guest and Her Majesty wanted to ensure that all branches of the duke's family were there, and had to make some very difficult decisions about who would be there. For those that unfortunately can't be there, I'm sure they will be making their own private arrangements about how they commemorate the duke, and indeed celebrate the duke. '</p>\n<p>Also missing from the list is the Duchess of Sussex, who is pregnant with her second child was told by doctors not to fly, and the duke's 10-great-grandchildren, who are all considered too young to attend.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>During his many years of public duty and service he undertook more than 220 solo visits to Commonwealth countries between 1949 and 2016, with many more alongside the Queen.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the Earl of Wessex thanked holders and participants of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, and the International Award, for sharing their memories of his father and their experiences of the award.</p>\n<p>He said: 'Reading just some of the wonderful memories you have shared about your experiences of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award and, in some cases, of meeting my father, has been truly uplifting.</p>\n<p>'I think I may have said once that he was a man that once met, never forgotten. He had a unique ability to make a lasting impression in a remarkably short time.</p>\n<p>'I, like all my family, have a lifetime of lasting impressions, inspiration, shared passions and love. He may have departed this world, but his spirit and ethos lives on through his award, through each and every life touched, transformed, inspired; then, now and in the future.</p>\n<p>'Thank you one and all for helping to create such an extraordinary tribute.'</p>\n<p>Boris Johnson also paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh's 'amazingly distinguished' career in the navy during a visit to the college where he was a cadet.</p>\n<p>The Prime Minister said his thoughts were once more with the Queen while at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, which is where the young royal couple met for the first time in 1939.</p>\n<p>King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the naval college with their two daughters, when Philip, then 18, and the 13-year-old Elizabeth had their first publicised meeting.</p>\n<p>In commemoration of the duke, Mr Johnson attended a passing out parade at the Devon college today, where he congratulated naval cadets as they became officers and spoke with them about their career ambitions.</p>\n<p>The PM said: 'I'm here at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, which is the college from which the Duke of Edinburgh himself passed out, became an officer in 1940, before going on to have that amazingly distinguished naval career, the Battle of Cape Matapan, Sicily and then seeing the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay.</p>\n<p>'We've just seen those wonderful cadets become officers themselves and incarnating the finest traditions of the Royal Navy in the way that the duke did himself.</p>\n<p>'And actually, funnily enough, here in this very garden, I think in 1939, the Duke of Edinburgh met the then Princess Elizabeth for the very first time. So, our thoughts are with her again today.'</p>\n<p>In May 1939, Philip, then aged 17, entered the college as a special entry naval cadet for training, following the footsteps of his paternal grandfather and uncles.</p>\n<p>He was named best cadet on his course before beginning a career in the Royal Navy that saw him serve during the Second World War and reach the rank of commander.</p>\n<p>During the Second World War, he served on several ships, firstly on HMS Ramillies, and saw active service against German, Italian and Japanese forces.</p>\n<p>The Armed Forces are stepping up preparations for the duke's funeral on Saturday which will feature servicemen and women from the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Army and RAF alongside top military brass.</p>\n<p>One of the four Royal Marine buglers who will play 'The Last Post' at the service said it was an 'honor and privilege' to perform the role.</p>\n<p>'It's incredibly important. We feel nervous,' Sgt. Bugler Jamie Ritchie. 'We feel the pressure, but we're channelling that and we're using that and we're going to deliver an outstanding performance.</p>\n<p>'We've rehearsed, we've fine-tuned, and we've made sure that the last post itself will be ready and will make an incredibly poignant moment in the service,' added Ritche, who will wear the medal he received personally from Prince Philip after serving in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile it also emerged today members of the Royal Family will now not wear military uniform at the funeral.</p>\n<p>It is understood the Queen decided senior royals attending the service should be in civilian clothing.</p>\n<p>The move means the Duke of Sussex will not have to face being one of the only close family members who is not in uniform at Saturday's service.</p>\n<p>Harry lost his honorary military titles after deciding to step down as a senior working royal.</p>\n<p>Reports had also suggested the Duke of York, who spoke of his father as being 'the grandfather of the nation,' was considering wearing an admiral's uniform.</p>\n<p>Andrew stepped down from royal duties over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2019.</p>\n<p>He was due to be promoted to Admiral in 2020 to mark his 60th birthday but this did not go ahead following the fallout from his disastrous Newsnight appearance.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Children look at a floral tribute left by the Long Walk at Windsor Castle today following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Police officers on the Long Walk at Windsor Castle today as Thames Valley Police prepares for the funeral on Saturday\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Wardens stand outside Windsor Castle today following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh at the age of 99 last Friday\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Police on patrol at Windsor Castle today following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh at the royal residence last Friday\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"The funeral will take place at St George's Chapel which is in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where a warden is pictured today\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Police officers on the Long Walk at Windsor Castle today as the world prepares to say farewell to Philip this Saturday\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Seven-year-old Max Taylor from Berkshire wears his great grandfather's Grenadier Guards sash on the Long Walk today\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Police officers on the Long Walk at Windsor Castle today ahead of the funeral which takes place on Saturday at 3pm\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>The decision is a break with tradition for ceremonial royal funerals and will contrast with the strong military presence which will be on show to honour Philip, who served with distinction in the Second World War.</p>\n<h3>The Queen and Prince Philip's beloved niece and nephew Sarah Chatto and the Earl of Snowdon who holidayed with the family as children are BOTH invited to the funeral </h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"Prince Philip's beloved niece Sarah Chatto in London in 2017\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>Prince Philip's beloved niece Sarah Chatto in London in 2017</p>\n<p>The Queen and Prince Philip's beloved niece and nephew Sarah Chatto and the Earl of Snowdon will join mourners at Philip's funeral.</p>\n<p>Buckingham Palace said the Queen faced 'some very difficult' decisions as she selected the 30 guests permitted under Covid-19 rules, from the original 800-strong congregation, and had tried to ensure all branches of the duke's family were there.</p>\n<p>The Queen is particularly close to Lady Sarah, who is the daughter of her late sister Princess Margaret and is one of the most low-key Royals.</p>\n<p>It is said that in some respects Sarah, a successful artist who is 21st in line to the throne, reminds the Queen of her much-missed sister Margaret, to whom she was very close.</p>\n<p>One royal insider previously revealed: 'The Queen adores Sarah and seeks out her company as often as possible. She is her absolute favourite younger Royal.</p>\n<p>'They are hugely at ease in each other's company. Much giggling can be heard when they are together. They share a sense of loyalty, fun, duty and the ridiculous.'</p>\n<p>One acquaintance said: 'Sarah is very unassuming; shy and almost embarrassed with no grandeur at all.

including his son the Prince of Wales - were posted on official royal Twitter accounts.</p>\n<p>The Queen has continued to work as she grieves, carrying out an official engagement yesterday to formally welcome her new Lord Chamberlain to his post.</p>\n<p>The official engagement was recorded in the Court Circular, a daily list of the events attended by the Queen and her family.</p>\n<p>It said: 'The Lord Parker of Minsmere had an audience of the Queen today, kissed hands upon his appointment as Lord Chamberlain and received from Her Majesty the Wand and Insignia of Office and the Badge of Chancellor of the Royal Victorian Order, when the Queen invested him with the Insignia of a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.'</p>\n<p>Andrew Parker, Baron Parker of Minsmere, officially took up his new role on April 1, following the Earl Peel's retirement after more than 14 years in the post.</p>\n<p>The Earl Peel had overseen arrangements for the duke's funeral, known as Operation Forth Bridge, before handing responsibility to his successor just over a week before Philip died peacefully at Windsor Castle.</p>\n<p>Baron Parker served as director general of MI5 from April 2013 until last year and hosted a visit by the Queen to the intelligence agency.</p>\n<p>The image of the Queen and the duke with the young members of the family is a snapshot of a typical day at her private Scottish home where she entertains family, friends and politicians during the summer.</p>\n<p>Cradled in the arms of the Queen is Prince Louis, a rare image of the monarch holding one of her great-grandchildren.</p>\n<p>The full line-up of royal children includes the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's children Prince George and Princess Charlotte either side of the Queen who holds their brother Louis.</p>\n<p>Peter Phillips' daughters Savannah and Isla are close to their great-grandfather and at the other end of the sofa are Zara and Mike Tindall's children Lena, held by her cousin Isla, and his daughter Mia.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall visit the gardens of Marlborough House in London this morning\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Prince of Wales appears emotional as he views the tributes with the Duchess of Cornwall at Marlborough House today\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall visit the gardens of Marlborough House today to view the flowers and messages\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Prince of Wales surveys the tributes as he visits the gardens of Marlborough House in London to view the flowers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Prince Philip tributes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall look at messages about Philip on a bench at Marlborough House today\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall view a selection of flowers today that have been left by members of the public\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visit the gardens of Marlborough House in London today to view the flowers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>A black and white picture posted on Charles and Camilla's official Twitter account, taken in 1966, shows Philip and Charles sitting on polo ponies with mallets and helmets in hand during a match.</p>\n<h3>'Difficult' decisions made by Queen as Covid-19 impacts Philip's funeral </h3>\n<p>The Duke of Edinburgh's funeral will be profoundly different to services held for royal family members before him, with coronavirus restrictions to have a huge impact on arrangements.</p>\n<p>Philip's ceremonial royal funeral will take place on Saturday in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, with the royal household and the military working round the clock to ensure everything is ready for the historic occasion.</p>\n<p>Buckingham Palace said the Queen faced 'some very difficult' decisions as she selected the limited number of guests allowed to attend, and had tried to ensure all branches of the duke's family were there.</p>\n<p>A congregation of 30 people will attend the funeral, the maximum number of guests allowed under the Government's Covid-19 regulations. They will be seated in The Quire at the chapel and will wear face masks, Buckingham Palace confirmed.</p>\n<p>Rules stipulate that a face covering is required by law when attending indoor places of worship, crematoriums and burial ground chapels. The funeral was originally planned long ago for 800 guests but had to take into account the strict limit on numbers during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>The Queen will be accompanied to the funeral in the state Bentley by a lady-in-waiting, but will sit alone in St George's Chapel. As the Queen is staying at Windsor with around 20 staff members, dubbed HMS Bubble, she is unable to form a support bubble with another household.</p>\n<p>She will sit by herself in the quire of the chapel, with all mourners following Covid-19 guidelines and remaining socially distanced.</p>\n<p>Couples who are within one household, such as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, will be able to sit together.</p>\n<p>A small choir of four people will sing music chosen by Philip, and will be located in the nave away from the seated guests who will not join in with the singing.</p>\n<p>A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'At its heart it is still a family event. We are following the Covid guidelines. There was a limit on who could be invited as a guest and Her Majesty wanted to ensure that all branches of the duke's family were there, and had to make some very difficult decisions about who would be there. For those that unfortunately can't be there, I'm sure they will be making their own private arrangements about how they commemorate the duke, and indeed celebrate the duke.'</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>The image was posted alongside a more modern image of the duke with his son and the duchess in the moments after William and Kate's Westminster Abbey wedding.</p>\n<p>William and Kate also shared memories of Philip and the Queen, posting an image taken at Balmoral in 2015 on their official Twitter account showing the couple with their children George and Charlotte.</p>\n<p>Earlier yesterday, the Queen's granddaughter Princess Eugenie paid a heartfelt tribute to her 'dearest Grandpa', pledging to look after 'Granny' the Queen for him.</p>\n<p>The Princess Royal also reminisced fondly about learning to sail as a child with her father as she returned to public duties.</p>\n<p>Anne visited the Royal Yacht Squadron in Cowes on the Isle of Wight where she met spoke fondly to club members of her 'links' and 'early memories of sailing' there.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Ross Kemp has said the Duke of Edinburgh's Award will form part of its founder's legacy as he called for donations to a fund aiming to help a million young people complete the scheme.</p>\n<p>The actor is a supporter of the award, which is hoping to reach the target over the next five years with its Living Legacy Fund.</p>\n<p>The money will help to establish new centres, train thousands more leaders and volunteers and provide targeted help to young people who need specialist support to complete their award, the DofE Award charity previously announced.</p>\n<p>Former EastEnders star Kemp, 56, said: 'The Duke of Edinburgh's Award is part of his legacy and I think it's something he wholeheartedly supported because of his belief in young people.</p>\n<p>'It's open to people from all walks of life, people who are marginalised, young offenders can get on the course, people in schools, people who are members of clubs and, as I say, it gives not only value to yourself but also helps you to understand the value of being part of a community.</p>\n<p>'Particularly coming out of lockdown you can't underestimate that.'</p>\n<p>Kemp said he has 'witnessed first hand the difference it can make to a young person's life' and has handed out awards to participants.</p>\n<p>'It helps people's self-belief, it gives people life skills, it helps them to deal with things that might be thrown at them in later life,' he said.</p>\n<p>He described Philip as 'someone who had a lot of faith in young people' and added the award helps people 'connect with their community in a positive way'.</p>\n<p>Kemp said there had been an 'outpouring of support' for Philip after his death, adding: 'I think many people wouldn't have thought that you would see that and I think that shows there's such massive support for the royal family in this country still, from all walks of life and all areas.'</p>\n<p>Other celebrities supporting the Living Legacy Fund include actor Hugh Jackman and actress Nina Wadia.</p>\n<p>Some 6.7million young people across the UK have taken part in the scheme and achieved more than 3.1 million awards since 1956. The scheme sees participants complete tasks to help their community or environment, developing new skills and completing an expedition.</p>\n<p>Donations can be made to the Living Legacy Fund at dofe.org/livinglegacy.

He was always generous with his time.'</p>\n<p>Major General Holmes said the Royal Marines Band Service will perform at the funeral, which is taking place this Saturday at Windsor Castle.</p>\n<p>Recounting memorable moments with the duke, he said: 'From my recollection there were a number of formal events that he attended.</p>\n<p>'The one that really stands out is when he flew all the way to Exeter airport from London to meet one of my companies returning from Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>'He spent an hour on the ground. He hated fuss, so we would host him and he would go straight amongst the marines and talk to our valiant warriors.'</p>\n<p>He said the duke would be interested in the modernisation of defence, adding: 'Certainly I think he was interested, in particular, in innovation and technological developments.'</p>\n<p>It has emerged members of the royal family will now not wear military uniform at the duke's funeral.</p>\n<p>The move means the Duke of Sussex will not have to face being one of the only close family members who is not in uniform at Saturday's service.</p>\n<p>Harry lost his honorary military titles - including Captain General of the Royal Marines, which he had taken from his grandfather in 2017 - after deciding to step down as a senior working royal last year.</p>\n<h3>Who's who on the guest list for Prince Philip's funeral?</h3>\n<p>The Queen had the difficult choice of selecting just 30 guests for the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. Here is a look at who has been confirmed as attending:</p>\n<p>1. The Queen</p>\n<p>The nation's longest-serving head of state, who was married to the duke for 73 years, will lead mourners as they gather in St George's Chapel on Saturday. Elizabeth II has reigned for 69 years and faces the remainder of her time on the throne without her loyal consort at her side.</p>\n<p>- PHILIP'S CHILDREN AND THEIR SPOUSES</p>\n<p>2. The Prince of Wales</p>\n<p>Future king Charles, the Queen and Philip's eldest son, is the nation's longest-serving heir to the throne. He will process with other members of the royal family as they walk behind the specially modified Land Rover carrying Philip's coffin through the castle grounds.</p>\n<p>3. The Duchess of Cornwall</p>\n<p>Camilla, once a royal mistress now a future Queen, will be supporting her husband Charles during his time of grief. The duchess, who has carved out a royal role for herself promoting literacy and campaigning against domestic abuse, is known for her down-to-earth and friendly nature, and will be a pillar of strength for the prince.</p>\n<p>4. The Duke of York</p>\n<p>Andrew will make his first appearance at an official royal event at the funeral since stepping down in 2019 from royal duties after his disastrous Newsnight interview about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Virginia Giuffre, who says she was trafficked by Epstein as a teenager, said she was left 'horrified and ashamed' after an alleged sexual encounter with the duke in London in 2001. Andrew, who was previously dubbed Air Miles Andy amid criticism of his globe-trotting, denies he had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Ms Giuffre.</p>\n<p>5. The Earl of Wessex</p>\n<p>Edward, the Queen and Philip's youngest son, worked closely with his father on his Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme.</p>\n<p>6. The Countess of Wessex</p>\n<p>Edward's wife Sophie is being hailed as a great source of comfort for the Queen as she mourns for Philip. The monarch had a close relationship with the former PR executive, who has been visiting the Queen at Windsor in the days following Philip's death.</p>\n<p>7. The Princess Royal</p>\n<p>Anne, the Queen and Philip's only daughter, is often seen as the most hard-working member of the royal family. The princess has the same no-nonsense abrupt attitude as her father. She is known for keeping to the same bouffant hairstyle for decades.</p>\n<p>8. Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence</p>\n<p>Anne's husband is a familiar face at official royal engagements but the dependable royal rarely takes centre stage. The naval officer, who wed the princess in 1992 the same year she divorced her first spouse Captain Mark Phillips, has told of his and Anne's shared love of the sea, but admitted he does not share her affection for horses.</p>\n<p>- THE GRANDCHILDREN AND SPOUSES</p>\n<p>9. The Duke of Cambridge</p>\n<p>Second in line to the throne William - the Prince of Wales and the late Diana, Princess of Wales's eldest son - has paid tribute to the duke as an 'extraordinary man'. The funeral will be the first time the future monarch has been seen at an official event with his brother the Duke of Sussex since Harry quit as a senior royal and carried out his bombshell Oprah interview.</p>\n<p>10. The Duchess of Cambridge</p>\n<p>Kate, a future Queen, will be at husband William's side. It will be the first major royal funeral the duchess has attended. Seen as both calm and caring, Kate has taken to her royal role with ease over the years.</p>\n<p>11. The Duke of Sussex</p>\n<p>Harry, who has rushed back from the US, is self-isolating at Frogmore Cottage. His attendance is the first time he will have been seen publicly with the Windsors since he and Meghan accused an unnamed royal of making racist remarks about his son's skin tone before he was born, and the institution of failing to support a suicidal Meghan.</p>\n<p>12. Princess Beatrice</p>\n<p>Beatrice is the eldest daughter of the Duke of York and Sarah, Duchess of York. The 32-year-old has a full-time job at Afiniti, an artificial intelligence software firm, where she is vice president of partnerships and strategy.</p>\n<p>13. Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi</p>\n<p>Beatrice wed millionaire property tycoon Edo, a long-time family friend of the Yorks, in a secret lockdown ceremony last summer, with the Queen and Philip among the handful of guests. He is the son of former Olympic skier Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi and Nikki Williams-Ellis. Beatrice is stepmother to his young son Wolfie.</p>\n<p>14. Princess Eugenie</p>\n<p>Eugenie is Andrew and Sarah's youngest daughter and Philip's death has happened just weeks after the 31-year-old princess became a first-time mother. Her son August has the middle name Philip in tribute to his great-grandfather. Eugenie works as a director at the contemporary art gallery Hauser &amp; Wirth in London.</p>\n<p>15. Jack Brooksbank</p>\n<p>Eugenie's husband is European brand director of Casamigos Tequila, co-founded by the actor George Clooney. They wed in St George's Chapel in 2018.</p>\n<p>16. Lady Louise Windsor</p>\n<p>Lady Louise is the 17-year-old daughter of the Earl and Countess of Wessex, and was close to her grandparents, particularly the Queen. She has embraced the pastimes associated with her grandfather, taking up carriage driving and starting her Duke of Edinburgh's Gold Award.</p>\n<p>17. Viscount Severn</p>\n<p>Lady Louise's brother, 13-year-old James is the youngest of Queen and Philip's grandchildren, and lives with his family at Bagshot Park, Surrey, 10 miles from Windsor Castle. Mischievous James was seen prodding his sister on the back of her legs with a rubbish grabber when he attended a beach litter-picking engagement last year.</p>\n<p>18. Peter Phillips</p>\n<p>The 43-year-old is the eldest son of the Princess Royal and was the duke's first grandchild. He has the key role of walking between his cousins William and Harry in the procession to the chapel. Mr Phillips, who announced his divorce from wife Autumn last year, runs the UK arm of events and sponsorship agency Sports and Entertainment Ltd (SEL). In 2016, his agency organised the Patron's Lunch celebration in honour of the Queen's 90th birthday.</p>\n<p>19. Zara Tindall</p>\n<p>Anne's daughter gave birth to her third child - the Queen and Philip's 10th great-grandchild - less than four weeks ago. She named her son Lucas Philip, with his middle name in honour of both the duke and husband Mike Tindall's father. The champion equestrian rider won a silver medal in the London 2012 Olympics with Team GB.</p>\n<p>20. Mike Tindall</p>\n<p>Zara's husband Mike is a former England rugby player, known for his relaxed approach to life and stints on celebrity shows The Jump and Bear Grylls: Mission Survive. He recounted the entertaining tale of how baby Lucas was born on the bathroom floor at home when there was not enough time for Zara to get to hospital, on a rugby podcast he co-hosts.</p>\n<p>- CLOSE RELATIVES OF THE QUEEN</p>\n<p>21. Earl of Snowdon</p>\n<p>The earl, formerly Viscount Linley, is the eldest child of the Queen's late sister Princess Margaret. He runs his own company making bespoke furniture under his professional name, David Linley, and separated from his wife Serena after 26 years in 2020.</p>\n<p>22. Lady Sarah Chatto</p>\n<p>Princess Margaret's daughter Lady Sarah has a strong bond with the Queen, who is said to adore her only niece. She keeps out of the royal limelight and is also said to be close to her cousin Charles, sharing a love of painting at Balmoral together.</p>\n<p>23. Daniel Chatto</p>\n<p>Lady Sarah Chatto's husband Daniel Chatto is an artist and former actor. Lady Sarah met Daniel on a sabbatical in India and they wed in 1994.</p>\n<p>24. Duke of Gloucester</p>\n<p>A first cousin of the Queen, Richard cut short his career as an architect to devote his life to royal duties following the death of his older brother Prince William in 1972. Mostly operating behind the scenes away from the glare of the media, the Gloucesters, with the Kents and Princess Alexandra, are part of the band of minor royals formed of the Queen's cousins, who have supported the monarch and Philip during her reign.</p>\n<p>25. The Duke of Kent</p>\n<p>Also the Queen's first cousin, Edward or 'Steady Eddie' - as the royals reportedly call him - carries out his minor role within the family with a dutiful and reliable good grace. He is perhaps best known for being President of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and presenting the Wimbledon trophies each summer.</p>\n<p>26. Princess Alexandra</p>\n<p>Princess Alexandra, another first cousin, has devoted decades of her life to royal duty and charity work. One of the most popular members of the family with royal relatives, the princess, 84, is loved for her kindness and warm nature.</p>\n<p>PHILIP'S GERMAN RELATIVES</p>\n<p>27. Bernhard, Hereditary Prince of Baden</p>\n<p>Prince Bernhard, 50, is the grandson of the duke's second sister Theodora.</p>\n<p>28. Prince Donatus, Landgrave of Hesse</p>\n<p>Prince Donatus, 54, known as Don, is head of the house of Hesse into which the duke's younger sister Cecile and Sophie married.</p>\n<p>29. Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg</p>\n<p>Philipp, 52, is the grandson of the duke's elder sister Princess Margarita.</p>\n<p>THE DUKE'S CARRIAGE DRIVING COMPANION</p>\n<p>30. Countess Mountbatten, Penelope 'Penny' Knatchbull</p>\n<p>Previously known as Lady Romsey and later Lady Brabourne, Penny was the duke's carriage driving partner and was one of his closest friends. She is the wife of Earl Mountbatten, Norton Knatchbull, who is the grandson of Philip's beloved uncle the 1st Earl Mountbatten, who was murdered by the IRA in 1979.</p>\n<p>WHO ELSE WILL BE IN THE CHAPEL?</p>\n<p>- The clergy and choir</p>\n<p>The 30 limit rule does not include clergy, and the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Dean of Windsor will preside over the service. A small choir of just four people, including one soprano, will sing pieces of music chosen by the duke.</p>\n<p>- Lady in waiting</p>\n<p>A lady in waiting, as yet unnamed by Buckingham Palace, will travel to the chapel with the Queen by car and enter the church, but as a member of the royal household, not as a guest. She will remain in the nave, and not be seated in the quire with the royal family.</p>\n<p>- The duke's private secretary</p>\n<p>- Brigadier Archie Miller Bakewell was the duke's right hand man for 11 years, taking on the role in 2010. He will process behind the duke's coffin with two pages and two valets, and will enter the chapel, but not be seated in the quire.</p>\n<p>WHO WILL BE MISSING?</p>\n<p>- The Duchess of Sussex</p>\n<p>Meghan, who is pregnant with her second child, has stayed in California after doctors advised her not to fly. But her attendance would have proved controversial in the wake of the allegations she raised during her Oprah interview.</p>\n<p>- The great-grandchildren</p>\n<p>The Queen and Philip's 10 great-grandchildren - Savannah and Isla Phillips; Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cambridge; Mia, Lena and Lucas Tindall; Archie Mountbatten-Windsor; and August Brooksbank - are considered too young to attend. All are aged 10 and under.</p>\n<p>- A first cousin - and spouses of cousins</p>\n<p>The Queen's cousin Prince Michael of Kent is not on the guest list, nor is his wife Princess Michael of Kent, or the Duchess of Kent and the Duchess of Gloucester - spouses of the Duke of Kent and the Duke of Gloucester.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<h2>How Army, Royal Navy and RAF regiments will play integral role in Philip's funeral</h2>\n<p>The Army, Royal Navy and RAF regiments will play an integral role in the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral on Saturday - as military personal took to the area surrounding St George's Chapel for a full-dress rehearsal today.</p>\n<p>Prince Philip's attachment to the Armed Forces predated even his 73-year marriage to his beloved wife the Queen - and this will be remembered during a grandiose send-off outside St George's Chapel on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/prince-philip/index.html\">Duke of Edinburgh</a> - who died at the age of 99 - was highly-decorated during his distinguished military career - which he gave up in 1953 when the Queen ascended the throne.</p>\n<p>And the Armed Forces have today been rehearsing for an eight-minute procession to lead Prince Philip's coffin from the Private Chapel to front steps of St. George's Chapel.</p>\n<p>At the duke's request, The Buglers of the Royal Marines will sound Action Stations during the funeral.</p>\n<p>And 14 service detachments recognising The Duke of Edinburgh's special military relationships will be in position in the Quadrangle, having formed up on Frogmore Drive and Mausoleum Road.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Soldiers in ceremonial dress arrive at Windsor Castle today ahead of the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral this Saturday\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The ceremonial arrangements are a reflection of The Duke's military affiliations and personal elements of His Royal Highness's life.'</p>\n<p>The forces taking part in the ceremony are:</p>\n<ul><li>The Royal Navy;</li><li>Royal Marines;</li><li>Band of the Royal Marines;</li><li>Royal Fleet Auxiliary;</li><li>The Queen's Royal Hussars (The Queen's Own and Royal Irish);</li><li>Grenadier Coldstream and Welsh Guards;</li><li>The Highlanders, 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland;</li><li>Royal Gurkha Rifles;</li><li>The Rifles;</li><li>REME;

They also filter out excess nutrients and pollutants while filter-feeding on plankton.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/hp3203-2017-23/threats/poaching/\">Nanyang Technological University</a> says poachers harvest the clams by dredging along the ocean floor and destroying coral reef systems with boat propellers. The shells are seen as a status symbol and can be used as ornaments, jewelry, tableware and even floor tiling.</p>"

Giant clams, known locally as <em>taklobo</em>, can grow larger than three feet across and weigh up to 600 pounds.</p>\n<p>The clams are considered to be essential to the local marine ecosystem, as they host algae that are a crucial food source for many of the fish species that humans eat.</p>\n<p>But conservationists have raised the alarm over the spike in demand for the creatures due to an increased scarcity of ivory, following a crackdown on the global trade of elephant tusks. Clam shells are popular for their meat and are also used as an alternative to ivory for a range of products, such as earrings and chandeliers.</p>\n<p>Punishment in the Philippines for killing an endangered species can be a fine of up to one million pesos ($20,000) and a 12-year jail sentence, the <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bbc\">BBC</a> reported.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the Philippines protested against the harvesting of giant clams by Chinese vessels in the West Philippine Sea, Rappler reported.</p>",

It is harming our city, county and state,&rdquo; Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt said in a statement Saturday. &ldquo;There are multiple criminal investigations underway to identify those responsible for last night&rsquo;s criminality.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Police said they are aware of plans for more demonstrations Saturday night in Oregon's largest city.</p>\n<p>Officers late Friday dispersed the crowd so firefighting crews could douse fires before they spread in extreme fire hazard conditions. In a statement, police said the damage from the late-night violence &ldquo;appears to be significant.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There aren't yet exact estimates of damages to buildings caused by the fires, but police say looters stole about $2,000 worth of products from a Nike store before on-site security personnel were able to stop the theft.</p>\n<p>The vandalism downtown came after the police shooting earlier Friday and was part of vigils and demonstrations already planned for the night in the name of people killed in police shootings nationwide. They include 13-year-old Adam Toledo of Chicago and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/daunte-wright\">Daunte Wright</a> a Black man in a Minneapolis suburb.</p>\n<p>Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis told reporters a white man in his 30s had been shot and killed in Portland by police. The man was pronounced dead at the scene in Lents Park, which is in a leafy, residential neighborhood of the city.</p>\n<p>Two officers fired a 40mm device that shoots non-lethal projectiles, and one officer &mdash; an eight-year veteran &mdash; fired a gun, police said in a statement. Police identified the officer who fired his gun as Zachary Delong. He is on paid administrative leave, authorities said.</p>\n<p>Davis said he did not know if the man who died had pointed a weapon at the officers and did not say how many shots were fired. A witness who spoke to reporters at the scene said the man, who had removed his shirt and was blocking an intersection, appeared to be having a mental health crisis, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported.</p>\n<p>The police investigation into the shooting was hampered by a crowd of &ldquo;fairly aggressive people&rdquo; who showed up at the park within two hours of the shooting. Those arrested could face charges ranging from assaulting a public safety officer to criminal mischief.</p>\n<p>There were no reports of injuries to police.</p>\n<p>As investigators worked the scene of the shooting and huddled over a covered body, nearly 100 yards (91 meters) away, a crowd of more than 150 people &mdash; many dressed in all black and some carrying helmets, goggles and gas masks &mdash; gathered behind crime scene tape, chanting and yelling at officers standing in front of them.</p>\n<p>The crowd later marched through the park, ripped down police tape and stood face to face with officers dressed in riot gear. Police left the park around 3:30 p.m., and the crowd eventually stood in a nearby intersection, blocking traffic and chanting.</p>\n<p>Police said they used pepper spray on protesters in order to keep them away.</p>\n<p>Portland has been the site of frequent protests, many involving violent clashes between officers and demonstrators, since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.</p>\n<p>Over the summer, there were demonstrations for more than 100 straight days. Earlier this week, a crowd set a fire outside the city's police union headquarters following recent fatal police shootings in Chicago and Minneapolis.</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p>Cline is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

I loved my kids.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Carrillo and the children&rsquo;s father, Erik Denton, had been embroiled in a bitter custody battle. Denton explained in court papers that the children weren&rsquo;t safe with Carrilo because she was &ldquo;increasingly delusional&rdquo; and had taken the children without telling him where they were. Carrillo fired back by filing a restraining order against Denton, claiming that he was an alcoholic who sexually abused their oldest daughter.</p>\n<p>In February, 3-year-old Joanna fell on her groin area during an outing at the park. After complaining that she was hurt, Carrillo started to believe that her daughter was being sexually abused by her father. She took Joanna to the doctor, but physicians found no evidence of abuse. Yet, she claimed inree court documents that the exam wasn&rsquo;t thorough enough and the children remained in her custody.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the bodies of Joanna, her 2-year-old brother, Terry, and 6-month-old sister, Sierra were found near Carrillo&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s apartment in <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/tag/los-angeles\">Los Angeles</a>. Carrillo was arrested later that day, nearly 200 miles north in Tulare County. She explained in the interview that she had been driving north with the intention of driving off a cliff to kill herself. When her car got stuck in a ditch, she stole the vehicle of some people who had stopped to help her.</p>\n<p>Despite admitting to the crimes in the interview, Carrillo pleaded not guilty to four felony counts of carjacking, attempted carjacking, and auto theft on Wednesday. She has yet to be charged with the deaths of her children.</p>",

For more than half her life, she had lived with abuse, violence, threats and drunken outbursts, he said.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, her husband had started talking to his machete, her brother said. &ldquo;&lsquo;Should I kill her? Should I kill her today?&rsquo;&rdquo; Ram&iacute;rez P&eacute;rez told her brother she heard her husband wonder. She started plotting her escape.</p>\n<p>She begged family and friends for the money to send her children over the border safely. Then she gathered three of her four children and traveled three days by bus from her home in La Mixteca, in the state of Oaxaca, to the Mexican border.</p>\n<p>With the kids safely across, she got into a maroon 1997 Ford Expedition in the early hours of 2 March. Inside the SUV, 23 migrants were packed body-to-body in the back, authorities later said, with all the seats except those of the driver and front passenger removed to create optimal space. Including the driver and front passenger, the car carried more than three times the number of people meant to safely ride in the vehicle.</p>\n<p>In the dusty farming town of Holtville, California, a semi-truck hauling two trailers slammed into the left side of the SUV just as the first rays of the sun began to break. Ram&iacute;rez P&eacute;rez was one of 13 who died in the crash.</p>\n<p>Heartbroken, her family and immigration advocates lament a US immigration system that could force a woman in a desperate search for safety to seek such dangerous avenues to cross the border. &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t coming here to live an American dream,&rdquo; Cynthia Santiago, an attorney for the family, said in an interview. &ldquo;She was coming here to live safely and to start a chapter where her kids could live safely. She just wanted to live.&rdquo;</p>",

In texts and social media posts, she said things like 'I wish I never had kids' and threatened to kill herself.</p>\n<p>Carrillo also believed she was 'solely responsible' for the coronavirus pandemic, Denton wrote, and she thought that Porterville - where the family had lived until the end of February - was home to a 'giant sex trafficking ring.'</p>\n<p>In her interview, Carrillo said she had dealt with depression, anxiety and PTSD her whole life and had sought out a therapist for post-partum depression but contended that it was her husband who posed a threat to the children.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Carrillo in court on April 14.

It showed that 93 per cent of people had produced coronavirus-specific <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/definition/antibodies/\">antibodies</a> after receiving the Pfizer vaccine and 87 per cent of people after receiving the AstraZeneca jab. This was the first study to compare the performance of the two vaccines.</p>\n<p>Those who received the AstraZeneca vaccine showed a greater T-cell response, which forms <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2253386-what-are-t-cells-and-why-have-they-become-a-political-football/\">another important arm of the body&rsquo;s immune response to viruses</a>. Just 12 per cent of people who had the Pfizer vaccine developed T-cells against the coronavirus spike protein compared with 31 per cent of those who had received the AstraZeneca jab.</p>\n<p>Overall immune responses were much higher in people who had previously had covid-19, compared with those who hadn&rsquo;t. The study was carried out by Helen Parry at the University of Birmingham, UK, and her colleagues who analysed immune responses in a group of 165 volunteers aged 80 and over, each of whom had received a single dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine five to six weeks earlier.</p>\n<p><b>Other coronavirus news</b></p>\n<p>The US, the European Union and South Africa are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-coronavirus-pandemic-ca22100350c70111ef4cd6ba947fe2da\">pausing rollouts of the Johnson &amp; Johnson covid-19 vaccine</a>, following a small number of reports of rare blood clots in people who had received it. In the US, six cases of rare blood clots had been reported among 6.8 million people who had received the vaccine as of 13 April. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it is working closely with the US Food and Drug Administration and other international regulators to investigate all the cases reported and it expects to issue a recommendation next week. &ldquo;While its review is ongoing, EMA remains of the view that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects,&rdquo; it <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-janssen-assessment-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-platelets-continues\">said in a statement</a> on 14 April.</p>\n<p>Denmark has become the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56744474\">first country to completely stop</a> using the AstraZeneca vaccine, after the EMA concluded on 7 April that unusual blood clotting events should be listed as very rare side effects of the vaccine. However, the country&rsquo;s health agency has not ruled out the possibility of resuming use of the vaccine in future if another wave of infections hits. Several European countries suspended use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in March over blood clot concerns, but many have since <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2274018-why-the-uk-changed-covid-19-astrazeneca-vaccine-advice-for-under-30s/\">resumed use of the vaccine for certain age groups</a>.</p>\n<p>About half of people in the UK may have antibodies against the coronavirus.

The equivalent proportions for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were 46 per cent, 49.1 per cent and 54.5 per cent, respectively. &ldquo;There is a clear pattern between vaccination and testing positive for COVID-19 antibodies but the detection of antibodies alone is not a precise measure of the immunity protection given by vaccination,&rdquo; the ONS said in its report.</p>\n<p><b>Coronavirus deaths</b><br>\n The worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.96 million.

So far, the White House has shown no signs of shifting from its policy of dividing vaccine doses among states based on population.</p>\n<p>Sending extra doses to places where infection numbers are climbing makes sense, said Dr. Elvin H. Geng, a professor in infectious diseases at Washington University. But it&rsquo;s also complicated. States that are more successfully controlling the virus might see less vaccine as a result.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want to make those folks wait because they were doing better,&rdquo; Geng said. &ldquo;On the other hand, it only makes sense to send vaccines to where the cases are rising.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The spike in cases has been especially pronounced in Michigan, where the seven-day average of daily new infections reached 6,719 cases Sunday &mdash; more than double what it was two weeks earlier. Only New York reported higher case numbers. And California and Texas, which have vastly larger populations than Michigan, are reporting less than half its number of daily infections.</p>\n<p>Though Michigan has seen the highest rate of new infections in the past two weeks, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has said she does not plan to tighten restrictions. She has blamed the virus surge on pandemic fatigue, which has people moving about more, as well as more contagious variants.</p>",

The two countries will continue to discuss &quot;concrete actions in the 2020s to reduce emissions aimed at keeping the Paris Agreement-aligned temperature limit within reach.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kerry arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday night under tight COVID-19 protocols and was transferred to a secluded hotel not open to the public. He subsequently travelled to Seoul.</p>\n<p>His stop in Shanghai was the first high-level visit to China by a Biden administration official since the new president took office, and followed a contentious exchange between officials from the two countries in March in Alaska.</p>\n<p>The talks also mark a resumption of climate dialogue between the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters. Bilateral discussions ground to a halt during the administration of Donald Trump, who withdrew from the 2015 Paris agreement after claiming it unfairly punished US businesses.</p>\n<p>The United States is expected soon to deliver a new pledge to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions in a bid to win back trust from foreign allies. Biden brought the United States back into the Paris climate accord.</p>\n<p>Li Shuo, senior climate adviser for the environmental group Greenpeace, said China could soon respond to a new US pledge with one of its own, building on the &quot;momentum&quot; of the Shanghai talks.</p>\n<p>&quot;The statement in my view is as positive as the politics would allow: It sends a very unequivocal message that on this particular issue (China and the United States) will cooperate. Before the meetings in Shanghai this was not a message that we could assume,&quot; Li said.</p>\n<p>Biden will hold a virtual summit for dozens of world leaders this week to discuss climate change, to be livestreamed for public viewing. Global climate talks are scheduled Nov 1-12 in Glasgow.</p>\n<p>The statement said the two countries also agreed to discuss specific emission reduction actions including energy storage, carbon capture and hydrogen. They said they would take action to maximise financing for developing countries to switch to low-carbon energy sources.</p>\n<p>The Paris agreement encourages countries to submit more ambitious climate pledges if they are able to do so. China has already promised enhanced actions as it tries to meet its goal to become &quot;carbon neutral&quot; by 2060.</p>",

I am so used to being called names, but a racist is one I will not take.&quot;</p>\n<p>Osbourne's decision to leave <em>The Talk</em> came after <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/the-talk-hosts-call-out-sharon-osbourne-for-defending-piers-morgan-162019\">a heated discussion about racism on the March 10 episode of <em>The Talk</em></a>. Osbourne's <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/sharon-osbourne-apologizes-after-heated-discussion-about-racism-on-the-talk-piers-morgan-responds\">defense of her longtime friend Piers Morgan</a> -- and <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/piers-morgan-leaves-good-morning-britain-following-meghan-markle-criticism-161923\">his controversial comments about Meghan Markle -- </a>sparked an argument between herself and her co-hosts. Osbourne said that Morgan had a right to express his opinion, while <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/the-talk-hosts-call-out-sharon-osbourne-for-defending-piers-morgan-162019\">Sheryl Underwood argued</a> that &quot;he doesn't want to understand how Meghan was treated was racism.&quot;</p>\n<p>Osbourne <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/sharon-osbourne-apologizes-after-heated-discussion-about-racism-on-the-talk-piers-morgan-responds\">later apologized on Twitter</a> &quot;to anyone of color that I offended and/or to anyone that feels confused or let down by what I said.&quot; The show was then put on hiatus, pending an investigation.</p>\n<p>&quot;[Meghan]'s entitled to her opinion. Piers is entitled to his,&quot; Osbourne told Maher while discussing the disagreement. &quot;That's what it's all about. You're entitled to have a disagreement, discuss it in a normal way. Just do your thing, that's all. Disagreeing with somebody does not make you a racist.&quot;</p>\n<p>Osbourne also touched on her former co-hosts' allegations against her. Shortly after the heated <em>Talk</em> discussion, Holly Robinson Peete claimed that Osbourne was one of the <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/holly-robinson-peete-alleges-sharon-osbourne-complained-she-was-too-ghetto-for-the-talk-162163\">reasons she was fired from the show</a> after one season and accused her former co-host of calling her &quot;too ghetto.&quot; <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/leah-remini-claims-sharon-osbourne-used-racist-and-homophobic-language-towards-the-talk-co-hosts\">Leah Remini also accused</a> Osbourne of calling her &quot;ghetto,&quot; and making racial and gender slurs toward Julie Chen and Sara Gilbert. <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/sharon-osbourne-responds-to-holly-robinson-peete-claiming-she-had-her-fired-from-the-talk-162225\">Osbourne denied</a> all the allegations made by her former co-hosts.</p>\n<p>Calling her former co-hosts &quot;disgruntled ladies,&quot; she said she &quot;never said&quot; that to Remini.</p>\n<p>&quot;I don't even use those words. They are not in my vocabulary,&quot; Osbourne claimed. &quot;For Holly, I think I said it all <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/sharon-osbourne-responds-to-holly-robinson-peete-claiming-she-had-her-fired-from-the-talk-162225\">when I printed the text</a> that she sent me after she said I got her fired.&quot;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/the-talk-returns-following-sharon-osbournes-exit-163671\"><em>The Talk</em> returned from its hiatus</a> on April 12. <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/latest/people/sheryl-underwood\">Underwood</a> addressed Osbourne's exit at the top of the show, saying that they needed to &quot;process the events of that day and what happened since so we can get to the healing.&quot;</p>\n<p>Dr. Donald E. Grant, an expert on diversity, equity, inclusion and justice, sat down with all the hosts -- including Underwood, Carrie Ann Inaba, Elaine Welteroth and Amanda Kloots -- to lead the conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>RELATED CONTENT:</strong></p>"

I am so used to being called names, but a racist is one I will not take.&quot;</p>\n<p>Osbourne's decision to leave <em>The Talk</em> came after <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/the-talk-hosts-call-out-sharon-osbourne-for-defending-piers-morgan-162019\">a heated discussion about racism on the March 10 episode of <em>The Talk</em></a>. Osbourne's <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/sharon-osbourne-apologizes-after-heated-discussion-about-racism-on-the-talk-piers-morgan-responds\">defense of her longtime friend Piers Morgan</a> -- and <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/piers-morgan-leaves-good-morning-britain-following-meghan-markle-criticism-161923\">his controversial comments about Meghan Markle -- </a>sparked an argument between herself and her co-hosts. Osbourne said that Morgan had a right to express his opinion, while <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/the-talk-hosts-call-out-sharon-osbourne-for-defending-piers-morgan-162019\">Sheryl Underwood argued</a> that &quot;he doesn't want to understand how Meghan was treated was racism.&quot;</p>\n<p>Osbourne <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/sharon-osbourne-apologizes-after-heated-discussion-about-racism-on-the-talk-piers-morgan-responds\">later apologized on Twitter</a> &quot;to anyone of color that I offended and/or to anyone that feels confused or let down by what I said.&quot; The show was then put on hiatus, pending an investigation.</p>\n<p>&quot;[Meghan]'s entitled to her opinion. Piers is entitled to his,&quot; Osbourne told Maher while discussing the disagreement. &quot;That's what it's all about. You're entitled to have a disagreement, discuss it in a normal way. Just do your thing, that's all. Disagreeing with somebody does not make you a racist.&quot;</p>\n<p>Osbourne also touched on her former co-hosts' allegations against her. Shortly after the heated <em>Talk</em> discussion, Holly Robinson Peete claimed that Osbourne was one of the <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/holly-robinson-peete-alleges-sharon-osbourne-complained-she-was-too-ghetto-for-the-talk-162163\">reasons she was fired from the show</a> after one season and accused her former co-host of calling her &quot;too ghetto.&quot; <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/leah-remini-claims-sharon-osbourne-used-racist-and-homophobic-language-towards-the-talk-co-hosts\">Leah Remini also accused</a> Osbourne of calling her &quot;ghetto,&quot; and making racial and gender slurs toward Julie Chen and Sara Gilbert. <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/sharon-osbourne-responds-to-holly-robinson-peete-claiming-she-had-her-fired-from-the-talk-162225\">Osbourne denied</a> all the allegations made by her former co-hosts.</p>\n<p>Calling her former co-hosts &quot;disgruntled ladies,&quot; she said she &quot;never said&quot; that to Remini.</p>\n<p>&quot;I don't even use those words. They are not in my vocabulary,&quot; Osbourne claimed. &quot;For Holly, I think I said it all <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/sharon-osbourne-responds-to-holly-robinson-peete-claiming-she-had-her-fired-from-the-talk-162225\">when I printed the text</a> that she sent me after she said I got her fired.&quot;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/the-talk-returns-following-sharon-osbournes-exit-163671\"><em>The Talk</em> returned from its hiatus</a> on April 12. <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/latest/people/sheryl-underwood\">Underwood</a> addressed Osbourne's exit at the top of the show, saying that they needed to &quot;process the events of that day and what happened since so we can get to the healing.&quot;</p>\n<p>Dr. Donald E. Grant, an expert on diversity, equity, inclusion and justice, sat down with all the hosts -- including Underwood, Carrie Ann Inaba, Elaine Welteroth and Amanda Kloots -- to lead the conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>RELATED CONTENT:</strong></p>"

Her exit came after <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/cbs-extends-the-talk-hiatus-second-time-amid-sharon-osbourne-controversy/\">the series extended its hiatus</a> for a second time, PEOPLE confirmed, as the network continued to look into Osbourne's behavior following her controversial defense of <a href=\"https://people.com/tag/piers-morgan/\">Piers Morgan</a> on the March 10 episode.</p>\n<p>In a statement about Osbourne's exit from the show, CBS said that her behavior &quot;<a href=\"https://people.com/tv/sharon-osbourne-exits-the-talk/\">did not align with our values</a>.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Sharon Osbourne has decided to leave <em>The Talk</em>,&quot; the statement read. &quot;The events of the March 10 broadcast were upsetting to everyone involved, including the audience watching at home. As part of our review, we concluded that Sharon's behavior toward her co-hosts during the March 10 episode did not align with our values for a respectful workplace.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;We also did not find any evidence that CBS executives orchestrated the discussion or blindsided any of the hosts,&quot; the statement continued. &quot;At the same time, we acknowledge the Network and Studio teams, as well as the showrunners, are accountable for what happened during that broadcast as it was clear the co-hosts were not properly prepared by the staff for a complex and sensitive discussion involving race.&quot;</p>\n<p>In addition to &quot;coordinating workshops, listening sessions and training about equity, inclusion and cultural awareness for the hosts, producers and crew,&quot; CBS also said that they &quot;are identifying plans to enhance the producing staff and producing procedures to better serve the hosts, the production and, ultimately, our viewers.&quot;</p>\n<p>During the March 10 episode, Osbourne defended Morgan amid backlash for his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1368860561660903426\">controversial remarks</a> questioning the validity of <a href=\"https://people.com/tag/meghan-markle/\">Meghan Markle</a>'s discussion on mental health during her <a href=\"https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1368860561660903426https:/people.com/royals/meghan-markle-oprah-interview-suicidal-didnt-want-be-alive/\">recent interview with Oprah Winfrey</a>.</p>\n<p>&quot;She's entitled to her opinion, Piers is entitled to his,&quot; Osbourne told Maher on Friday of Morgan's comments about Markle. &quot;And that's what it's all about.&quot;</p>\n<p>She added, &quot;Disagreeing with someone does not make you a racist in my book.&quot;</p>\n<p>Osbourne's defense of Morgan on <em>The Talk</em> last month <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/sharon-osbourne-tears-up-as-she-defends-piers-morgan-in-wake-of-meghan-markle-criticism/\">led to an intense exchange</a> with co-host <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/everything-sheryl-underwood-has-said-about-the-sharon-osbourne-racism-dispute-on-the-talk/\">Sheryl Underwood</a>, who pushed back on Osbourne's downplaying of Morgan's comments.</p>\n<p>&quot;To anyone of color that I offended and/or to anyone that feels confused or let down by what I said, I am truly sorry. I panicked, felt blindsided, got defensive &amp; allowed my fear &amp; horror of being accused of being racist take over,&quot; she wrote on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrsSOsbourne/status/1370266292846960641/photo/2\">Twitter</a>. &quot;There are very few things that hurt my heart more than racism so to feel associated with that spun me fast. I am not perfect, I am still learning like the rest of us &amp; will continue to learn, listen and do better.&quot;</p>\n<p>Osbourne added, &quot;I hope we can all hold each other up with accountability, compassion &amp; love during this powerful time of paving the way for so much needed change.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Want to get the biggest stories from</em> PEOPLE <em>every weekday? </em><a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-people-every-day-76003809/\"><em>Subscribe to our new podcast</em></a><em>,</em> PEOPLE Every Day, <em>to get the essential celebrity, entertainment and human interest news stories Monday through Friday.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The British TV personality has also been the subject of claims that she used <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/sharon-osbourne-repeats-racial-slur-in-new-denial-racism-allegations-the-talk-mount/\">racist, homophobic and bullying language</a> in her interactions with former co-hosts <a href=\"https://people.com/tag/holly-robinson-peete/\">Holly Robinson Peete</a>, <a href=\"https://people.com/tag/leah-remini/\">Leah Remini</a>, <a href=\"https://people.com/tag/sara-gilbert/\">Sara Gilbert</a> and <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/sharon-osbourne-repeats-racial-slur-in-new-denial-racism-allegations-the-talk-mount/\">Julie Chen</a> &mdash; all of which <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/sharon-osbourne-denies-new-allegations-of-racism-and-bullying-as-the-talk-extends-hiatus/\">she has denied</a>.</p>\n<p>Osbourne told Maher Friday that she &quot;never ever&quot; used a slur referring to Remini.</p>\n<p>&quot;I don't even use those words,&quot; she said. &quot;They're not in my vocabulary.&quot;</p>\n<p>Of past feuds with former <em>The Talk</em> co-hosts, Osbourne said: &quot;It's disgruntled ladies.&quot;</p>\n<p>On March 16, journalist Yashar Ali published a <a href=\"https://yashar.substack.com/p/exclusive-sharon-osbourne-frequently\">report</a> alleging that Osbourne used several racial slurs while referring to Chen, citing multiple unnamed sources <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/sharon-osbourne-denies-new-allegations-of-racism-and-bullying-as-the-talk-extends-hiatus/\">as well as Remini</a>.</p>\n<p>Osbourne called the claims &quot;crap, all crap,&quot; in an interview first given to <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9371909/Sharon-Osbourne-hits-allegations-called-former-host-Julie-Chen-wonton.html\"><em>Daily Mail</em></a>, but <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/sharon-osbourne-repeats-racial-slur-in-new-denial-racism-allegations-the-talk-mount/\">repeated the racist language</a>.

He said there was &ldquo;clear evidence,&rdquo; assembled by the Czech intelligence and security services, showing &ldquo;reasonable suspicion&rdquo; that the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/world/europe/unit-29155-russia-gru.html\">Russian group, known as Unit 29155</a>, had been involved in the blasts in late 2014, which killed two Czechs.</p>\n<p>The announcement underscored the breadth of Russia&rsquo;s efforts to expand its influence and pursue aggressive actions around the world, including military-style operations, assassinations and cyberattacks.</p>\n<p>The elite Russian unit has operated for at least a decade, focusing on subversion, sabotage and assassination beyond Russia&rsquo;s borders. It first came to light after the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/world/europe/russia-uk-novichok-skripal.html\">March 2018 attack in Salisbury, England, on a turncoat Russian ex-spy,</a> Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, using the nerve agent Novichok. Both fell gravely ill but later recovered.</p>\n<p>Britain blamed the Salisbury attack on Russian military intelligence, known as the G.R.U., and identified two of its agents, who traveled under fake names as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, as the prime suspects.</p>\n<p>As the prime minister spoke in Prague, the anti-organized-crime unit of the Czech national police issued its own statement, saying that two Russian men using the same names were wanted in connection with an unspecified &ldquo;serious crime&rdquo; and were known to have been in the Czech Republic &mdash; including the Zlin region, where the ammunition depots exploded &mdash; from Oct. 11 to Oct. 16, 2014, the date of the first blast.</p>\n<figure><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)\" srcSet=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/17/us/17czech-3/merlin_186544812_35901f25-aee9-45ea-aadd-3ab19832d167-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale&width=600\"></source><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)\" srcSet=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/17/us/17czech-3/merlin_186544812_35901f25-aee9-45ea-aadd-3ab19832d167-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale&width=1200\"></source><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)\" srcSet=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/17/us/17czech-3/merlin_186544812_35901f25-aee9-45ea-aadd-3ab19832d167-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale&width=1800\"></source><img alt=\"Protesters left a poster denouncing Vladimir V.

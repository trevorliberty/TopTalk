This latest drive will seek to get jabs into the arms of the people at risk of developing serious disease or death and who have historically had less access to health care than wealthier communities.</p> <p>The government will invest $3 billion in a program that aims to boost confidence in vaccines and overcome the skepticism and anti-science sentiment that is undermining the biggest public health exercise in decades. It will also launch a program to vaccinate patients undergoing dialysis. Kidney disease disproportionately affects minorities and those patients often have severe outcomes if they become infected with the virus.</p> <p>At his first press conference since taking office, Biden <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-announces-new-covid-vaccines-goal-200-million-shots-in-his-first-100-days-11616696589?mod=home-page">doubled down on his goal</a> for COVID-19 vaccinations, saying he is now aiming for 200 million shots in arms in his first 100 days in office.</p> <p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s ambitious &mdash; twice our original goal &mdash; but no other country in the world has even come close, not even close, to what we&rsquo;re doing.
